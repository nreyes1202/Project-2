## About this project

When each level is cleared new 'stars' or objects appear for you to clear.  The first two 'monsters' are TA's the final 'Boss' is the Teacher Chris.  The player uses arrow keys and the space bar to move the alien around.  At the end of the game the player is prompted to put their name on the score board.  The names and scores are recorded in the database hosted on Heroku.

## Details of App and Challenges

Right now each player gets shown in the leader board twice.  In future versions this duplicte can be found and fixed.

The leader board is not sorted by higest score, in future versions this can be improved.

The game ends at 1000 points because that improved our ability to demonstrate the game in class.  In future versions this can be improved.

We wanted to allow the player to pick their charector and background, we ran into dificulties implamenting that with Phaser.  In future versions this could be added.
